    "In statistics, a k-th percentile, also known as percentile score or centile, is a score (e.g., a data point) below which a given percentage k of all scores in its frequency distribution exists (\"exclusive\" definition) or a score at or below which a given percentage of the all scores exists (\"inclusive\" definition); i.e. a score in the k-th percentile would be above approximately k% of all scores in its set. For example, the 97th percentile of data is a data point below which 97% of all data points exist (by the exclusive definition). Percentiles depends on how scores are arranged. (Wikipedia)\n",
