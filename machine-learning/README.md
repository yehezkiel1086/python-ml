# Machine Learning

Machine Learning is:
- making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.
- a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

## Requirements

- Maths, particularly Statistics
- Python basics and some Python modules

## Dataset

Definition: A collection of data

> In Machine Learning, it's common to work with very large data sets.

## Data Types

3 main categories:
- Numerical
  - Discrete: counted data that are limited to `ints` (e.g: numbers of cars passing by)
  - Continous: measured data that can be any  number. (e.g: temperature)
- Categorical: can't be measured against one another (e.g: color, yes/no values)
- Ordinal: like categorical but can be measured against one another (e.g: grade [1 is lower than 10])

## Mean, Median, Mode

3 statistics values that are of interest in Machine Learning:
- Mean: average value
- Median: mid point value
- Mode: most common value

## Standard Deviation

- Standard Deviation: 

  Standard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the values are.

  A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value.

  A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range.

- Variance:
  
  Variance is another number that indicates how spread out the values are.

  In fact, if you take the square root of the variance, you get the standard deviation!

  Or the other way around, if you multiply the standard deviation by itself, you get the variance!
